# Template for a new cothority protocol/service/app

Building on the ONet-library available at 
https://github.com/dedis/onet, this
repo holds templates to build the different parts necessary for a cothority
addition:

* protocol - define an ephemeral, distributed, decentralized protocol
* service - create a long-term service that can spawn any number of protocols
* app - write an app that will interact with, or spawn, a cothority

This repo is geared towards PhD-students who want to add a new functionality to
the cothority by creating their own protocols, services and apps.

## Starting

You can go-get the repo, then start your project on a new branch. This allows
you to follow the main cothority-template in case something needs to be
updated. We suppose you already forked the cothority-template repo into your
account at `yourlogin`.

```bash
go get -u github.com/dedis/cothority_template
cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/dedis/cothority_template
git remote add perso git@github.com/yourlogin/template
git checkout -b my_new_project
git push -u perso my_new_project
```

Now you can do all your development in `$(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/dedis/cothority_template`
until you are proficient enough to move it either to the main-repository at
`dedis/cothority` or adjusting the paths and publish it under your own repo.

## Documentation

You find more documentation on how to use the template on the wiki:
[Cothority Template](https://github.com/dedis/cothority_template/wiki)

More documentation and examples can be found at:
- To run and use a conode, have a look at 
	[Cothority Node](https://github.com/dedis/cothority/wiki)
	with examples of protocols, services and apps
- To participate as a core-developer, go to 
	[Cothority Network Library](https://github.com/dedis/onet/wiki)
